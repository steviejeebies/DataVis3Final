LatT/LonT | 1 (Positional, Accuracy)

LonP/LatP (people) = positional

LonC/LatC

temp = numerical (continuous) | 5*

mon/day = date

days = intervals

city = list 

survivors = numerical/ordinal (continuous) | 2 (Area) (Prioritizing Accuracy, think about range/discriminability) (or brightness?)

direction = categorical (binary) | 3 (Hue, separability)

division = categorical (binary) | 4 (texture, grouping)




representing Division was tricky as size was used for number and hue was used for direction

brightness -> ordinal accuracy
